Class for Arduino, to detect rising edge, or descending flank on Digital Pins.

Easy way to detect and process, if a Button is pushed or released.

Simply place the Button.h File, in the same Folder as your .ino File.
Setup your .ino file like in ihe ButtonClassExample.ino

Now you are able to get:
-Button pushed: true
-Button pushed: false
-Button released true
-Button released false

If you want to add more Buttons, just declare more.
